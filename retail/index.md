# Retail home page
Dynamics 365 for Operations – Retail delivers a complete shopping experience, with a seamless and differentiating omni-channel solution that is modern, mobile, and global. End-to-end capabilities, from modern point of sale (POS) software solutions, store operations, merchandising, e-commerce, call center, marketing, and customer care, to supply chain, financials, and more, can be deployed in the way that makes the most sense for your business.

This page points to resources that will help you use Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations - Retail more effectively. On the leftmost pane, select a feature area to learn more about it. 

## Set up Retail channels
As you set up your Retail experience, you'll decide how to define and configure your brick and mortar store (called *retail store* in Dynamics 365 for Operations) and online store operations. 

Each retail store can have its own payment methods, price groups, POS solutions, income accounts, expense accounts, and staff. After you create your retail store, you assign the products that you want the store to carry. You also assign employees, registers, and customers to the store. Finally, you add the new store to an organization hierarchy.

When you create your online store, you must set up components such as assortments, attributes, payment methods, and shipping methods. You can also define prices, promotions, discounts, and shipping terms that are specific to the online store.

## Set up a call center
You can set up a call center as a type of retail channel. In a call center, workers take orders from customers over the phone and create sales orders. To help your workers take orders and handle customer service throughout the order fulfillment process, you can set up what a sales order will contain, how pricing will be controlled, and what data about customers, products, and pricing can be accessed. For each call center, you can also set up users, payment methods, price groups, financial dimensions, and modes of delivery.

## Define your POS and MPOS solutions
Retail Modern POS (MPOS) is a point-of-sale app for PCs, tablets, and phones. Sales staff can process sales transactions, customer orders, and perform daily operations and inventory management with mobile devices anywhere in the store, as well as at PC-based registers. Cloud POS is a browser-based POS. 

There are several components you’ll set up to define the relationships among a store, the POS registers or channels within the store, and the retail peripherals that those registers or channels use to process transactions. You’ll also define the characteristics of a specific instance of the POS, including the hardware profile or setup for retail peripherals that will be used at the register, the store that the register is mapped to, and the visual experience for the user who logs on to that register.

## Set up a customer loyalty program
You can set up your loyalty program so that customers earn points based on specific criteria, and the points can be calculated in various ways. Your loyalty program can be simple or complex, and apply across your legal entities in any retail channel.
-   [Set up a customer loyalty program](set-up-customer-loyalty-program.md)

## Set up discounts and price adjustments
You can make price adjustments to products, and can also set up discounts that are applied to a line item or a transaction at the POS, in a call center sales order, or in an online order.

-   [Define channel-specific discounts](define-channel-specific-discounts.md)
-   [Determine the optimal combination of overlapping discounts](optimal-combination-overlapping-discounts.md)

## Set up retail products
Before you can offer products for sale in your retail channels, you'll need to create and configure the products in Dynamics 365 for Operations. You can create the products, define the product properties and attributes, and assign the products to retail category hierarchies. To make the products available to your retail channels and add them to an active assortment, you'll then release the products to the legal entities in which they are available.

## Monitor and analyze performance
Using your Dynamics 365 for Operations data, you can analyze store performance, customer and product profitability, sales trends, and more.
