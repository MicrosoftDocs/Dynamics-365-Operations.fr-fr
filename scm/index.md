## Blogs
There are many topics about manufacturing and supply chain management on the <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/axmfg/">Dynamics AX Manufacturing R&D Team Blog</a> and <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dynamicsaxscm/">Supply Chain Management in Dynamics AX R&D Team Blog </a>. Most of these were written for the previous version of Dynamics 365 for Operations, but the same concepts still apply, and the procedures are similar in the current version. 

For example, you can read the recent posts about: 
* <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dynamicsaxscm/2017/01/20/announcing-dynamics-365-for-operations-warehousing/">Announcing Dynamics 365 for Operations – Warehousing</a>
* <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dynamicsaxscm/2016/12/01/improved-packing-functionality-dynamics-365-for-operations-1611/">Improved packing functionality (Dynamics 365 for Operations 1611)</a>
* <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/axmfg/2017/02/13/cross-docking-from-production-orders-to-transfer-orders/">Cross docking from production orders to transfer orders</a>

## White papers
* The <a href="https://mbs.microsoft.com/customersource/northamerica/AX/learning/documentation/white-papers/msd365optgtstcostacc/">Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations - Getting Started with Cost Accounting</a> white paper provides the basic steps to configure Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations – Cost Accounting in order to make the actual cost analysis. It also provides a series of procedures that you can complete in the order which they appear.
* The <a href="https://mbs.microsoft.com/customersource/northamerica/AX/learning/documentation/white-papers/leanmanufkanban365opt/">Dynamics 365 for Operations - Lean Manufacturing: Capable to Promise and Kanban Job Scheduling</a> white paper describes the details of kanban job scheduling and introduces the concept of sales order taking that uses the capable to promise (CTP) method for delivery date control. It also explains how CTP can be combined with event kanbans to model assemble-to-order or build-to-order scenarios.
* The <a href="https://mbs.microsoft.com/customersource/northamerica/AX/learning/documentation/white-papers/365operationsbomcalsheet/">Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations - BOM Calculation by Using a Costing Sheet</a> white paper describes how to set up a costing sheet that includes material and manufacturing, and how the setup affects the BOM calculation results. You can do exercises in the Appendix for learning purposes, and use the knowledge that you’ve gained from reading this document to do BOM calculation analysis.
